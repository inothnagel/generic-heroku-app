<h1>What is Generic Heroku App?</h1>

<p>Generic Heroku App is designed to be a blank-canvas Heroku App ready for deployment. It won't suit all uses, but it represents the basic starting point that I like for most of my personal / internal Rails apps. As such, it pre- set up to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Devise for user authentication</li>
  <li>Twitter Bootstrap for styling</li>
  <li>Rails Admin</li>
  <li>Mail with SendGrid</li>
  <li>JQuery-UI</li>
</ul>

<p>The app is still heavily under development, so feel free to make suggestions or pull requests.</p>

<h2>Setup:</h2>

<p>Setup process includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new app on Heroku.</li>
  <li>Set up SendGrid on your Heroku App.</li>
  <li>Set up the Heroku remote in git.</li>
  <li>Push to Heroku.</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<p>There's a lot of setup still required for a full turnkey generic heroku app, such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Add user authorization to rails_admin via cancan.</li>
  <li>Add email confirmatio to user sign up.</li>
  <li>Add a blank heroku scheduler rake task.</li>
</ul>
